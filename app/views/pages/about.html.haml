  %h1 About goodbre.ws
  
  %p
    Goodbrews is a web application that's good for three things: keeping track of which
    beers you like, keeping track of which beers you don't like, and receiving recommendations
    for what beer to try next! Here's how it works: 
  
  %br/
  
  %ol
    %li Register an account using the link above
    %li Like or dislike some beer
    %li Receive some recommendations!
  
  %br/
  
  %p
    Yup, it's that easy. Recommendations are refreshed within minutes of you liking or disliking a new beer!
    Best of all, new features for Goodbrews are being developed all the time. The website is free to use and
    has no ads.
