      Goodbrews is a web application that's good for three things: keeping track of which
      beers you like, keeping track of which beers you don't like, and receiving recommendations
      for what beer to try next! Here's how it works: 
    
    %p
      %ol
        %li Register an account using the link above
        %li Like or dislike some beer
        %li Receive some recommendations!
    
    %p
      Yup, it's that easy. Recommendations are refreshed within minutes of you liking or disliking a new beer!
      Best of all, new features for Goodbrews are being developed all the time. The website is free to use and
      has no ads.

      too! He frequently checks the feedback forums (visit using the tab on the left), so
